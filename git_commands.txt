git remote add origin URLOFPROJECT ||| sets up a new url as the default place to upload info online

git push origin master ||| uploads {pushes} any new commits to the ORIGIN url and the MASTER branch. You could also do “git push origin test” to push it to the test branch, etc, etc…

GETTING STUFF FROM GITHUB
